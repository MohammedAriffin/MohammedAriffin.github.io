        <h3>1. Priority Based Round Robin Scheduler</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project involves the implementation of a scheduling algorithm that combines aspects of both Priority Scheduling and Round Robin Scheduling. Processes are assigned priorities, and the scheduler ensures fairness through a round-robin approach within each priority level.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Improved process execution efficiency, reduced waiting times for high-priority tasks, and enhanced system responsiveness.</p>
